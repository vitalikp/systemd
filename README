REQUIREMENTS:
        Linux kernel >= 3.0
        Linux kernel >= 3.8 for Smack support

        Kernel Config Options:
          CONFIG_DEVTMPFS
          CONFIG_CGROUPS (it is OK to disable all controllers)
          CONFIG_INOTIFY_USER
          CONFIG_SIGNALFD
          CONFIG_TIMERFD
          CONFIG_EPOLL
          CONFIG_NET
          CONFIG_SYSFS
          CONFIG_PROC_FS
          CONFIG_FHANDLE (libudev, mount and bind mount handling)

        Udev will fail to work with the legacy layout:
          CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED=n

        Legacy hotplug slows down the system and confuses udev:
          CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER_PATH=""

        Userspace firmware loading is not supported and should
        be disabled in the kernel:
          CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER=n

        Some udev rules and virtualization detection relies on it:
          CONFIG_DMIID

        Support for some SCSI devices serial number retrieval, to
        create additional symlinks in /dev/disk/ and /dev/tape:
          CONFIG_BLK_DEV_BSG

        Required for PrivateNetwork in service units:
          CONFIG_NET_NS

        Optional but strongly recommended:
          CONFIG_IPV6
          CONFIG_AUTOFS4_FS
          CONFIG_SECCOMP

        For systemd-bootchart, several proc debug interfaces are required:
          CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS
          CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG

        For UEFI systems:
          CONFIG_EFIVAR_FS
          CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION

        Note that kernel auditing is broken when used with systemd's
        container code. When using systemd in conjunction with
        containers, please make sure to either turn off auditing at
        runtime using the kernel command line option "audit=0", or
        turn it off at kernel compile time using:
          CONFIG_AUDIT=n
        If systemd is compiled with libseccomp support on
        architectures which do not use socketcall() and where seccomp
        is supported (this effectively means x86-64 and ARM, but
        excludes 32-bit x86!). This works correctly only on kernels
        3.14 and newer though. TL;DR: turn audit off, still.

        glibc >= 2.14
        libcap
        libseccomp >= 1.0.0 (optional)
        libblkid >= 2.20 (from util-linux) (optional)
        libkmod >= 15 (optional)
        PAM >= 1.1.2 (optional)
        libaudit (optional)
        libselinux (optional)
        liblzma (optional)
        make, gcc, and similar tools

        During runtime, you need the following additional
        dependencies:

        util-linux >= v2.19 (requires fsck -l, agetty -s),
                      v2.21 required for tests in test/
        dbus >= 1.4.0 (strictly speaking optional, but recommended)
        sulogin (from util-linux >= 2.22 or sysvinit-tools, optional but recommended,
                 required for tests in test/)
        dracut (optional)
        PolicyKit (optional)

        When building from git, you need the following additional
        dependencies:

        docbook-xsl
        xsltproc
        automake
        autoconf
        libtool
        intltool
        gperf
        gtkdocize (optional)

USERS AND GROUPS:
        Default udev rules use the following standard system group
        names, which need to be resolvable by getgrnam() at any time,
        even in the very early boot stages, where no other databases
        and network are available:

        tty, dialout, kmem, video, audio, lp, cdrom, tape, disk

        During runtime, the journal daemon requires the
        "journal" system group to exist. New journal files will
        be readable by this group (but not writable), which may be used
        to grant specific users read access.

WARNINGS:
        systemd will warn you during boot if /etc/mtab is not a
        symlink to /proc/mounts. Please ensure that /etc/mtab is a
        proper symlink.

        systemd will warn you during boot if /usr is on a different
        file system than /. While in systemd itself very little will
        break if /usr is on a separate partition, many of its
        dependencies very likely will break sooner or later in one
        form or another. For example, udev rules tend to refer to
        binaries in /usr, binaries that link to libraries in /usr or
        binaries that refer to data files in /usr. Since these
        breakages are not always directly visible, systemd will warn
        about this, since this kind of file system setup is not really
        supported anymore by the basic set of Linux OS components.

        systemd requires that the /run mount point exists. systemd also
        requires that /var/run is a a symlink to /run.

        For more information on this issue consult
        http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/separate-usr-is-broken

        To run systemd under valgrind, compile with VALGRIND defined
        (e.g. ./configure CPPFLAGS='... -DVALGRIND=1'). Otherwise,
        false positives will be triggered by code which violates
        some rules but is actually safe.
