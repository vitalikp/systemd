Known differences between dbus1 and kdbus:

- Applications have to deal with spurious signals they didn't expect,
  due to the probabilistic bloom filters. They need to handle this
  anyway, given that any client can send anything to arbitrary clients
  anyway, even in dbus1, so not much changes.

- clients of the system bus when kdbus is used must roll their own
  security.

- Serial numbers of synthesized messages are always (uint32_t) -1.

- The org.freedesktop.DBus "driver" service is not special on
  kdbus. It is a bus activated service like any other with its own
  unique name.

- NameOwnerChanged is a synthetic message, generated locally and not
  by the driver.

- There's no standard per-session bus anymore. Only a per-user bus.
